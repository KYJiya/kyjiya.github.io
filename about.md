__Researcher__  
__Korea Astronomy & Space Science Institute__  
-> Operation of sunspot observing device, solar radio wave observing device, and solar radio burst locator (KSRBL).  
Upgrade of KSRBL operation program and post-processing of observation data (IDL and LabVIEW).  
Implementation and study of simulations to predict the amount of radiation exposure of crew members of the International Space Station in the event of a solar explosion (FORTRAN)

> __2011 ~ 2014__  
__Ph.D candidate__   
__Graduate School Kyung Hee University: School of Space Research__
