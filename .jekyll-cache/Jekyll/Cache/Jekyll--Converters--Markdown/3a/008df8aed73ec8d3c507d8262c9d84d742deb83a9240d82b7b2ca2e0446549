Space science is a field of science that includes everything 192 kilometers above Earth.<br />
Therefore, I not only learned astronomy, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, which are pure sciences, but also took basic optics to help understand telescopes, fluid mechanics and electromagnetics necessary for rocket design, C++, Labview language classes for machine control, and IDL script language for data analysis.<br />
Also, I was interested in software development, took other classes such as Continuous and Descrete Signals and Systems, and Data Structures.
